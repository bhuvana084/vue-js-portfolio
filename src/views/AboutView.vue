            With over 15 years of progressive experience, I am a highly motivated, continuous
            learner with a proactive, customer-centric approach. A dedicated problem solver &
            out-of-the-box thinker with a sharp eye for detail, consistently delivering an
            exceptional customer experience. As a servant leader, I foster a collaborative, high-
            efficiency work culture, whether working with a team or independently while ensuring
            high-quality results within agile processes. My foundation with people, process and
            technology along with strong communication skills enable effective stakeholder
            engagement, ensuring on-time, on-budget project delivery. With a passion for DevOps and
            continuous delivery, I am well-equipped to lead teams in executing projects beyond their
            immediate scope while maintaining product quality. I actively seek opportunities to
            expand my knowledge and contribute expertise in engineering management to
            customer-centric organizations.
